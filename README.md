## FAQ
- [In my country multiple cities can have the same postal code?](#in-my-country-multiple-cities-can-have-the-same-postal-code-what-do-i-do)
- [When we group together multiple cities, which location should we keep?](#when-we-group-together-multiple-cities-which-location-should-we-keep)

### In my country multiple cities can have the same postal code. What do I do?
Most of the time these cities are relatively small and are grouped together for convenience. Right now information at the postal code level is sufficient for the self-reporting process. Grouping should (if possible) occur to either the biggest or most important city in the region or to an appropriate name. Joining the cities by ";" is another possibility.

### When we group together multiple cities, which location should we keep?
Location should be kept to the city selected for the location or can be set to the geometric mean of the locations involved.
